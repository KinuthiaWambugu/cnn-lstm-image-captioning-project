This project focuses on building a CNN model that extracts features from an image and can classify if an input is an image or non-image(painting, sketch, schematics or text.
From this project, 

  1. The CNN is built on PyTorch and it has high accuracy of 91% for the classification task.
  2. For the LSTM, it is done through Kaggle notebooks. This is because we were working with the MS COCO dataset 2017 which is quite huge.

The notebooks are fully annotated on the work done and weights were saved. Moreover, Python scripts for testing are also available.
